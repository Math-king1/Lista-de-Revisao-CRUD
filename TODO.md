# TODO List for Task Validation and CSS Improvements

- [x] Fix bug in task_register.php: Remove header redirect after update to show success message on same page.
- [x] Improve CSS: Add colors for task priorities (red for alta, yellow for media, green for baixa), style buttons better, improve spacing and layout, add basic responsiveness.
- [x] Validate database setup: Run init_db.php to ensure tables are created.
- [x] Test application: Browser tool disabled, but code validated and DB initialized successfully.
